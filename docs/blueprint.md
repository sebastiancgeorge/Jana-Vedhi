- Background color: Very light green (#F1F8F0), providing a clean and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FF8A65) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, contrasting with the green hues for better visibility and engagement.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile and readable humanist sans-serif, which offers a balance of modernity and approachability suitable for both headings and body text.
